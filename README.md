# cookbook-rkt
A full port of [Cookbook-hs](https://github.com/natepisarski/Cookbook-hs/) to the [Racket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(programming_language)) programming language.

This doesn't include anything from the `Project` or `Recipes` Wing (see: [doc](https://github.com/natepisarski/Cookbook-hs/#readme)) but includes everything else.
